 * Import fidelity run: a real Figma node -> our HTML -> pixels, compared
 * against Figma's own render of the same node.
 *
 * This is the mirror of `run-export.ts`. It calls the real `mapFigmaNodeToHtml`
 * converter — the same pure function `import-figma-frame` uses — so a fix here
 * is a fix in the product, not in a test double.
 *
 * Needs a Figma personal access token with `file_content:read`, supplied as
 * FIGMA_FIDELITY_TOKEN. That is deliberately NOT the app's `FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN`
 * vault key: this is a local QA harness, and the app's credential must keep its
 * single vault-backed resolver.
 *
 * Every REST response and reference render is cached under
 * `.tmp/figma-fidelity/import-cache/`, because Figma allows only 10-20 Tier 1
 * requests per minute and an uncached re-run would burn the budget on repeat
 * fetches rather than on new cases.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   FIGMA_FIDELITY_TOKEN=... pnpm figma-fidelity:import          # whole corpus
 *   FIGMA_FIDELITY_TOKEN=... pnpm figma-fidelity:import <filter> # matching ids
