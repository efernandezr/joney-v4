# Blocks fields

## Why this exists

An article, a comment, and a Discussion message should support the same useful content rather than forcing people into a plain-text side channel or making every small body a full Page.

## Example workflow

A reviewer writes a Comment containing a Page reference and a code Block, while an author keeps a research-notes field beside the Page body. Each body renders through the same grammar, but only the intended field is revised or recovered.

## Product contract

- A Blocks field is one editable rich-content body with stable identity and a canonical owning object.
- Page bodies, additional rich fields, Comments, and Discussion messages reuse the grammar; their ownership and access do not collapse into one Page.
- Field history distinguishes atomic Events, logical Revisions, recovery snapshots, and named Page Versions.
- Typed Blocks preserve source when a renderer is unavailable and report a degraded state rather than dropping content.
- A multi-field action can share causality while retaining which field changed.

## Boundaries and non-goals

- A Blocks field does not become a top-level Page, Database row, or sharing principal.
- It does not decide Page Version branching, cross-field merge, or generic query history.
- Shared grammar does not imply every renderer is supported in every host.

## Acceptance stories

### Reuse grammar without merging ownership

Given a Page body and a Comment body containing references, when each is edited, then both use compatible Blocks while Comment access and history remain owned by the Comment's Page context.

### Recover exactly one body

Given a Page with two Blocks fields, when an authorized editor restores one field, then the other field, title, Properties, and memberships remain unchanged and a new attributable Revision records the recovery.

## Current evidence

Primary and additional database Blocks properties now retain distinct field identities, ordered Block identities, and independent monotonic revisions around their existing Markdown stores. Shared actions can list and mutate one exact database Blocks field with field-level compare-and-swap, sibling preservation, stable IDs, durable retry receipts, and verified read-back. Export reports each field and its identity status without changing plain NFM. Comment/Discussion owners, attributable history, arbitrary restore, and real-interface proof remain incomplete, so this is `in_progress`, not verified.

## Proof plan

1. Author equivalent typed content in every supported field owner and compare serialization/rendering.
2. Verify per-field identity, history, recovery, deletion, and inaccessible rendering.
3. Test agent, human, and automation edits with causal attribution and concurrent writes.
4. Exercise UI, Actions, export, import, keyboard, and assistive technology paths.

## Open questions

The exact first set of non-Page field owners can grow incrementally; no owner may claim grammar compatibility without its own proof.
